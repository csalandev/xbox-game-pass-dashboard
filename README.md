# 📊 Xbox Game Pass Sales Dashboard (Excel + VBA)

This repository contains an interactive sales dashboard built in **Microsoft Excel (2007+) with VBA**, designed to transform raw subscription data into clear business insights using a structured **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** approach.  
The project was developed as part of the **Santander Bootcamp (DIO)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how Excel can be used as a complete analytical tool — from data preparation to visualization — even in **legacy environments** where modern features (such as native slicers) are not available.

The focus is not on visual complexity, but on **data modeling, logic separation, and decision-oriented analysis**.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions Answered

The dashboard answers the following analytical questions:

- **Revenue Composition**: What is the total revenue split between subscriptions *with* and *without* auto-renewal?
- **EA Play Performance**: What is the total EA Play subscription revenue by selected period?
- **Minecraft Season Pass**: What is the total Minecraft Season Pass revenue by period?
- **Xbox Game Pass Revenue**: What is the total revenue generated by Xbox Game Pass subscriptions by period?
- **Plan Mix Analysis**: What is the revenue share of each subscription plan within total Xbox Game Pass revenue?

All questions can be explored dynamically through the dashboard controls.

## 🧱 Technical Architecture (ETL)

The workbook follows a clear ETL-inspired structure, adapted to Excel:

### 1️⃣ Extract — Bases
- Raw transactional data.
- Treated as a **Single Source of Truth**.
- No manual edits are performed to preserve data integrity.

### 2️⃣ Transform — Cálculos
- Data aggregation performed using PivotTables.
- Metrics grouped and filtered by **Subscription Type** and period.
- Transformation logic is isolated from visualization.

### 3️⃣ Load — Dashboard
- KPI cards (Big Numbers), charts, and summary visuals.
- Period selection controls update all PivotTables simultaneously.
- Frozen panes and layout decisions emulate a web-style interface.

## 🛠️ Why VBA Instead of Native Slicers?

The original challenge suggested the use of Excel slicers.  
This project intentionally uses **VBA-based controls** for technical reasons:

- **Legacy Compatibility**: Native slicers were introduced in Excel 2010. VBA ensures compatibility with Excel 2007+, reflecting real-world enterprise constraints.
- **Centralized Control**: A single action synchronizes filters across all PivotTables.
- **Reliable Recalculation**: VBA forces full refresh and recalculation, avoiding common PivotTable cache issues in older Excel versions.

This choice reflects an architectural decision, not a limitation.

## 🔐 Data Governance & Worksheet Protection

To demonstrate basic data security concerns:

- Structural elements (formulas, PivotTables, and layout) are protected.
- Input and navigation areas remain accessible to users.
- Protection details are documented intentionally for educational clarity.

**Worksheet password:** `SDW_DIO_2026`

> This is a student project. The password is shared transparently to demonstrate protection strategy, not security through obscurity.

## 🤖 Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI tools were used as a **technical support resource**, mainly to:

- Review VBA structure and logic.
- Improve documentation clarity.
- Validate architectural decisions.

All analytical logic, modeling choices, and final implementation decisions were made manually.
